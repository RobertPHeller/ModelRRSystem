  * @section Introduction
  *
  * This is the documentation for all of the library functions, classes, 
  * and widgets.  This includes both the C++ implemented libraries and the
  * Tcl implemented libraries.  For most of the C++ implemented code there
  * is a Tcl interface included as part of the library.  The code is broken up
  * into modules and almost everything is in either a C++ or Tcl namespace.
  * This allows for multiple code libraries to be included or linked to without
  * global name conflicts.
