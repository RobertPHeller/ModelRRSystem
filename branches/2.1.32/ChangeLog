Sat Aug  4 09:08:21 2012

  2.1.31 Released:

	Fixed several unmatched bracket and brace issues (including the
	one in Bug#9).

	Changed the MRD module to the Azatrax module: added support for other
	upcoming Azatrax devices and allow for future Azatrax devices.

	Fixed minor bugs in the XPressNet (Tcl) code.

	Added a Tcl client module for the Raildriver Daemon.

Mon May 14 16:17:33 2012

  2.1.30 Released:

	Removed an errant assert from the FCF Support code.

	Updated documentation:
	    Wrote a simple mode Dispatcher tutorial.
	    Added private and protected sections to BWidget and SNIT classes.
		(Neither BWidget nor SNIT actually have private or protected
		 members, but there are members that should be consided 
		 private or protected.)
	    Added package and library version numbers to all API documentation.
	    Various other minor documentation fixes.

	Removed old code directories (Time Table V1 and Freight Car Forwarder 
	V1).

	Wrote pure Tcl (cross-platform) versions of the C/MRI and XPressNet
	libraries and started on a pure Tcl (cross-platform) library for NCE's
	cab bus.  (A pure Tcl (cross-platform) library for LocoNet is in the
	works.) The C++ coded versions of the C/MRI and XPressNet libraries
	will be phased out and will be deleted from the source tree in another
	couple of release cycles.  The whole system will be 100% all-platform,
	with all code compiling and running on all platforms.

	Wrote a pure Tcl (cross-platform) version of the Raildriver Daemon
	and created a cross-platform Tcl loadable module for the low-level 
	Raildriver IO class.  This daemon exists for MS-Windows now, but is
	not yet set up to auto run on hotplugging a Raildriver on MS-Windows.

	Cleaned up parts of the build code and did some general house-cleaning.

Sun Apr  1 13:09:54 2012

  2.1.29.3 Released:

	Fixed Version number problem which seems to have broken many of the
	Tcl programs. Changed intermediate version numbering to NOT use 
	letters.

	Did some testing and fixed some bugs with the XPressNet Code. Started
	on a virtual throttle program.  The virtual XPressNet throttle is 
	very much in early testing stages.  The XPressNet C++ Class library
	however has been much more throughly tested.

	Added a 'simple mode' to the Dispatcher program.  This allows creating
	simple CTC panels that just throw turnouts using the MRD-2U devices 
	from Azatrax to control NCE's Switch-Its.  This mode uses canned 
	scriptlets and requires no coding on the part of the user.  As Azatrax 
	developes additional USB control devices, this code will be updated.

Wed Jan 11 12:41:07 2012

  2.1.29b Released:

	Fixed conditional compilation bug in the MRD library.

Tue Jan  3 17:22:38 2012

  2.1.29a Released:

	Updated Vendor ID for the MRD library.

Sun Dec 11 09:33:35 2011

  2.1.29 Released:

	Added support for Azatrax MRD2-S and MRD2-U.  The MRD support 
	library cross-builds for Win32 under MinGW32.

	Converted the RailDriver code to use the libusb-1.0 API.

	Fixed some minor bugs here and there.

Tue May 17 10:25:55 2011

  2.1.28 Released:

	Fixed a problem with ReadStations, that caused a Segmentation Fault 
	when generating reports.  ReadStations was allowing the use of 1 as
	a station index, even though station index 1 is reserved for the
	Workbench station (which has one industry, the Repair Yard).  
	ReadStations has now been fixed to disallow a station index 1 and
	the Station accessor for the Industry object now has an assert() to
	cause a more useful error message in the future.  See Bug #2 at
	http://bugzilla.deepsoft.com/ for details.

	Internationalized the code.  All of the C++ and Tcl code how has all
	messages and labels (buttons, menus, etc.) internationalized.  
	Currently the only language defined is American English, but 
	translators are welcome to go through the POT files (available
	as part of the development packages) and produce translations.

	Updated the RPM spec file to include a vendor definition.


Sat Jan 29 13:16:55 2011

  2.1.27 Released:

	Fixed an error in the CMR/I code generated by Dispatcher.
		(Missing argument error).

	Added a Wrap As menu item to Dispatcher.  This allows the Dispatcher
	to create StarPack versions of the CTC Panel programs it generates.
	These StarPack versions are self-contained, standalone native 
	executable programs that can be run on the target system without having
	to install any additional code.

	Fixed a build error relating to the API documentation for the Tcl
	package libraries.

	Updated the section 1 man pages and created a master man page for 
	section 1.

Tue Nov  9 13:19:20 2010

  2.1.26 Released:

	Fixed a pile of SWIG warnings:  Warning 124 (language in
typemap depreciated) and Warning 509 (Overloading [with default
values]).

	Cleaned up C++ code to remove various compiler warnings:
comparison of signed and unsigned, missing value returns in non-void
functions, might be unitialized variables, unused variables, and
unhandled cases in switch statements. 

	Minor fixes to the installer.

	Fixed the RPM spec file to not strip executables.  Stripping the
executables trashes the starpacks.

	Fixed a few minor packaging problems (missing files).

	This is mostly a minor maintanence release.


Sun Jun 27 17:48:46 2010

  2.1.25 Released:

	Fixed a pile of SWIG<==>C++ namespace errors in several of the
C++ Tcl/Extention libraries, along with a few other misc. bugs.

	Fixed the installer to properly handle 64 and 32 bit Linux
archives. 

Tue May  4 11:37:21 2010

  2.1.24 Released:

	Make the standard Mrr library to be the one with the Boost
library and renamed the original version to Mrrnoboost. Development has
stopped for the Mrrnoboost library and it is now 'depreciated'. 
Eventually, it will be dropped from the package. Made the standard
Dispatcher to be the Boost version and changed the original non-Boost
version to be DispatcherNoBoost.  The DispatcherNoBoost program is now
depreciated and will eventually be dropped from the package.

	Added a new calculation program: LocoPull.  This is a program
for calculating how many cars a given power consist will be able to
pull, both on level straight grade and on curves and climbing grades.
It is based on the formulas presented in spreadsheet described in
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/XTrkCad/message/4983, which are in turn
based on the TrainBoard forum thread at the URL
http://www.trainboard.com/grapevine/showthread.php?t=114497. 


Fri Nov 27 08:50:42 2009

  2.1.23 Released:

	Converted all internal documentation (developer docs) to use doxygen.
	Doc++ and Tcl2Tex are no longer used.

	Man pages are now generated from the sources, both for developer docs
	(man3) and user docs (man1 and man8).  This will insure that the man
	pages will be in sync with the program code.

	Added desktop/start menu support files (.desktop and .png icons). 
	The MS-Windows installer adds a sub-menu to the Start menu and 
	puts links to all of the programs there. This should make things 
	easier for the point-and-click crowd.  

	All of the C++ library code is in C++ namespaces.

Fri Nov  6 12:43:13 2009

  2.1.22 Released:

	Added in support for XTrkCad Block and Switchmotor meta objects.

	   Updated the parser (both plain and Boost versions) and TrackGraph
	   class to provide support for the (experimental) Block and 
	   Switchmotor meta objects available as a compile time option with 
	   XTrkCad.  Support has also been added to the Dispatcher programs
	   to use the Block and Switchmotor meta objects in creating dispatcher
	   panels.

	Moved the support code for the TimeTable program into a namespace.

	Made some small changes to the MS-Windows socketpair code. 

Tue Aug 11 12:39:54 2009

  2.1.21 Released:

	Help changed to use a real HTML help viewer in the dialog and the
	old 'Hyper Help' hack is gone.  Help documents are built from the
	same source as the User Manual using tex4ht.

	Lots of fixes to the build process:

	   Sdx, tclkits, and Img libraries now included with the source.

	   An up-to-date RPM SPEC file is now included and RPMs for CentOS
	   will be available.  It should be possible to build RPMs for other
	   RPM-based distros and using the Alien program, these RPMs could
	   also be converted to .deb packages for Debian-based distros. Or
	   an enterprising Debian developer could create the Debian equivalent
	   of a RPM spec file and build a 'native' .deb package by looking
	   at the supplied spec file.

Fri May  1 13:03:50 2009

  2.1.20 Released:

	A new library has been added: a version of the XTrkCad parser that
uses the Boost Graph Library.  Along with this library, a version of
Dispatcher is included that uses this new library.  Both the older
version of the XTrkCad parser library (non-Boost) and the newer one are
available, along with both versions of the Dispatcher program. 
Eventually, the non-Boost versions will be depreciated and eventually
removed from the system.

	A minor bug in the Dispatcher code has been fixed.

	Minor bugs in some of the documention have been fixed.


Thu Jan  8 12:18:38 2009

  2.1.19 Released:

	Minor changes to Dispatcher -- fixed a bug in the CMRINode class code.

	Created a simple installer program.

	Changed the binary distribution archive structure, creating separate
	archives for pure binaries, develoment binaries, and documentation.

	Created man pages for executable programs.

Sun Jul 27 09:48:22 2008

  2.1.17 Released:

	Minor changes to Dispatcher.

	Preliminary User Documentation written for Dispatcher.

	A set of example Dispatcher Control Panels created and included in
	the distribution.


Thu Apr 24 09:36:32 2008

  2.1.16 Released:

	Two new programs:

		Dispatcher, a Dispatcher Control Panel Builder. It can also 
		load XTrkCAD layout files and draw a graph network of the 
		layout, which should be useful (?) in creating dispatcher 
		control panels.  This is an alpha release. No Documentation 
		yet.

		ModelRRSystem, an experimental launcher with simple window
		manager features.  This is an alpha and experimental release. 
		No Documentation yet.

	Minor parser fixes to handle minor changes in XTrkCAD layout files.

	Fixed a pile of problems with the build process.  The system now will
	build in a subdirectory.  This it is possible to build for multiple
	targets from a single source tree.  Yeah!

Fri Apr  4 15:26:34 2008

		used by the Freight Car Forwarder program.

	 Continued to flesh out the programming guide.

	 Fixed minor problem with the ReadConfiguration code.

Sat Nov  3 16:27:44 2007

  2.1.11 Released:

	Started work on a Programming Guide for the C++ and Tcl libraries.


Fri Feb  2 09:54:14 2007:

   2.1.7 Released:

	Many fixes to configure scripts and makefiles (many parts of
the build process have been fixed) to allow for cross-building for
MS-Windows, as well as more intelligent building under other systems. 
Someday I need to get a MacOSX build box and do a build for MacOSX.

	All Tcl/Tk code has been converted/adapted to the use of
StarKits and StarPacks for all platforms.  All Tcl coded build scripts
are now StarKits. All Tcl/Tk *programs* are now built as StarPack
executables.  Tcl/Tk does not need to be installed on the target system
and the StarPack executables can be copied as loose executable files,
without needing any support code installed (which facilitates installing
on dedicated machines, such as a yard boss's desktop or laptop).  Tcl
and Tk (with their development packages) are needed on the build
system, along with the BWidget and Snit extensions. And the Sdx kit is
needed as well as both native and target system TclKit executables.

	The C/C++ has been reorganized.  The C/C++ libraries are now
also the Tcl sharable load modules.  The Parser and Classes libraries
have been combined into a single library (eliminating the circular
dependency).  The separate Swig directory has been eliminated and the
Swig interface files (*.i) have been moved to the regular C/C++
subdirectories.  The C/C++ header files are now installed, so it is
possible to write C/C++ code on top of these libraries.

	Some of the Tcl/Tk code has been updated to make use of Snit
and/or BWidget.  The older version is still available, at least for the
time being.
