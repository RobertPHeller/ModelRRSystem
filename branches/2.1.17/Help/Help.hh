The help window provides on-line help.  The system uses a simple form a
"hyper-text", including links and images.  Links are shown underlined
and in blue.  There is a help topic list on the left side of the main
part of the help pop-up window and a text area on the right side.

The text area has three special keyboard commands:

  [s] or [S] -- search forwards.  Prompts for a string to search the
current text for.
  [r] or [R] -- search backwards.  Prompts for a string to search the
current text for.
  [g] or [G] -- go directly to another page of the help.

Double clicking on a topic in the topic list will display that topic's
help text.
