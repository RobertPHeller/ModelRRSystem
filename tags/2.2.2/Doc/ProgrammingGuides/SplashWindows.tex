\chapter{Creating Splash Windows}
\label{chapt:SplashWindows}
\typeout{$Id$}

Splash windows are windows that are displayed during program startup
and generally feature a company or program logo, some introductory text
and a progress meter and status text area describing the program startup
and initialization progress.

\section{Creating a Splash Window}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Snit spash widget creation},

\end{lstlisting}
The splash widget is implemented as a Snit widget type and are created
with the spash procedure.  This widget takes eight options:\index{Splash Windows!options|(}
\begin{description}
\item[-troughcolor] The color to use for the progressbar's trough.
\item[-titleforeground] The foreground color for the title text area.
\item[-statusforeground] The foreground color for the status text area.
\item[-background] The overall background color.
\item[-progressbar] Whether or not to include a progress bar.
\item[-image] The image to display as the main feature of the spash
screen (typically a company logo or product image).
\item[-icon] A small image to display next to the title text.
\item[-title] Text to display above the main spash image.
\end{description}\index{Splash Windows!options|)}
The splash widget defines four public methods:\index{Splash Windows!methods|(}
\begin{description}
\item[update] This method takes two arguments, 
\lstinline=statusMessage percentDone=, which supply the text for the
status message and the percent of the startup that has completed.  If
the completion done percentage is 100, the spash screen's ``click to
destroy'' function is enabled.
\item[enableClickDestroy] This method enables the spash screen's ``click
to destroy'' function.
\item[hide] This method hides (withdraws) the splash window.
\item[show] This method shows (unwithdraws) the splash window.
\end{description}\index{Splash Windows!methods|)}

Listing~\ref{lst:SPL:typicalUsage} shows how a splash window is
typically created and updated.  The procedure in lines 6-28 creates the
splash window and the procedure in lines 29-32 updates the status text
area and progress bar.  After withdrawing the main window, the splash
window is created and drawn (lines 34-36).  As progress is made during
program startup, the splash window is updates (lines 38, 42, 46, and
50). When the percent completed is set to 100, the splash window can be
removed when the user left-clicks anywhere on it.  The splash window this
code creates is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SPL:SplashScreen}.
