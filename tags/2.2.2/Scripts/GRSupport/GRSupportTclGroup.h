/** @defgroup GRSupport Graphics Support Code
  * These scripts provide support for additional graphical objects, including
  * (dashboard) instruments and touch screen widgets (similar to what is used
  * on Star Trek).
  *
  * At present little of this code is actually used by any of the Model Railroad
  * System programs, but it is provided for future use and for use by people
  * developing and exploring additional graphical user interface options.
