	  * DIGITAL5, or DIGITAL6.  And val is either a small decimal number
	  * (in the range of 0 to 255) or a list of button or switch names
	  * enclosed in parenthisises.  Only the events specified by the
	  * supplied mask are sent.
	  *
	  * REVERSER is the state of the reverser lever, values (much) less
	  * than 128 are forward, a value at or near 128 is neutral and values
	  * (much) greater than 128 are reverse.
	  *
	  * THROTTLE is the state of the Throttle (and dynamic brake).  Values
	  * (much) greater than 128 are for throttle (maximum throttle is are
	  * values close to 255), values near 128 are at the center position
	  * (idle/coasting), and values (much) less than 128 are for dynamic
	  * braking, with values aproaching 0 for full dynamic braking.
	  *
	  * AUTOBRAKE is the state of the Automatic (trainline) brake.  Large
	  * values for no braking, small values for more braking.
	  *
	  * INDEPENDBRK is the state of the Independent (engine only) brake.
	  * Like the Automatic brake: large values for no braking, small
	  * values for more braking.
	  *
	  * BAILOFF is the Independent brake 'bailoff', this is the spring
	  * loaded right movement of the Independent brake lever.  Larger
	  * values mean the lever has been shifted right.
	  *
	  * HEADLIGHT is the state of the headlight switch.  A value below 128
	  * is off, a value near 128 is dim, and a number much larger than 128
	  * is full. This is an analog input w/detents, not a switch!
	  *
	  * WIPER is the state of the wiper switch.  Much like the headlight
	  * switch, this is also an analog input w/detents, not a switch!
	  * Small values (much less than 128) are off, values near 128 are
	  * slow, and larger values are full.
	  *
	  * DIGITAL1 is the leftmost eight blue buttons in the top row, BB1,
	  * BB2 BB3, BB4, BB5, BB6, BB7, and BB8.
	  *
	  * DIGITAL2 is the rightmost six blue buttons in the top row and the

	  * BB13, BB14, BB15, and BB16.

	  * third from the left, BB17, BB18, BB19, BB20, BB21, BB22, BB23, and
	  * BB24. 
	  *
	  * DIGITAL4 is the rightmost four buttons on the bottom row, plus the
	  * zoom up and zoom down, plus the pan right and pan up buttons, named
	  * BB25, BB26, BB27, BB28, Zoom Up, Zoom Down, Pan Right, and Pan Up.
	  *
	  * DIGITAL5 is the pan left and pan down, range up and range down, and
	  * E-Stop up and E-Stop down switches, named Pan Left, Pan Down,
	  * Range Up, Range Down, Emergency Brake Up, Emergency Brake Down.
	  *
	  * DIGITAL6 is the whistle up and whistle down, Alert, Sand, P
	  * (Pantograph), and Bell buttons, named Whistle Up, Whistle Down,
	  * Alert, Sand, Pantograph, and Bell.
	  *
	  *  @param sendmask A mask of events to send event data about.  Only
