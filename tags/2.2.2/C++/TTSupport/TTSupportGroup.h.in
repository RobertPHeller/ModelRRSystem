/** @defgroup TimeTableSystem TimeTableSystem
  * @brief Time Table C++ support class library.
  *
  * This class library handles all of the low-level data structures and
  * processing for the TimeTable (V2) program.  This includes the representation
  * of scheduled trains, the stations they stop at (or go by), and the data
  * needed to generated formatted and printed timetables.
  * 
  * A time table system consists of a vector of stations, which are in the
  * order that the stations exist along the track. There is a map of cabs,
  * a map of trains, a vector of notes, and a hash table of print options
  * also stored in a train system.  In addition, there are some system wide
  * scalar parameter settings.
  * 
  * The Time Table class includes code to read and write itself to a specially
  * formatted text file for storage between editing or processing sessions.
  * The class includes a method to generate a LaTeX file, which can
  * be processed by LaTeX to create a formatted timetable which can
  * be printed.  It is assumed that the @c TimeTable.sty is available for
  * inclusion by the LaTeX system.
  *
  * The ideas and structure of this code was heavily influenced by Bruce
  * Chubb's Kalmbach book, 
  * How to Operate Your Model Railroad.
