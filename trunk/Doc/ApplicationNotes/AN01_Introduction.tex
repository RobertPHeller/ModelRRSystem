This application note presents the hardware and software for a 2' by 8'
H0 switching layout.  This module is a table top module and features a
central switch ladder with a number of dead end yard sidings.  Also
included is a ``main line'' track with a push-pull commuter train with
a signaled interlocking plant where this main line goes through the
central switch ladder.  The layout will use an assortment of Azatrax
devices to control turnouts, magnetic uncoupling ramps, and signals. It
will also use Azatrax IR sensors to detect trains at critical places.
It will be using a Lenz DCC system (XPressNet) to operate trains and
will interface to a PI Engineering Rail Driver and use the Rail Driver
as a throttle (for a switcher engine) and for turnout and magnetic
uncoupling ramp control.  While the specific layout presented in this
application note is somewhat contrived, many of the circuits and code
fragments would be applicatical to a more typical model railroad layout.
